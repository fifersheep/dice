# Dice

A sample Flutter game - Liar's Dice

## Project Idea

It's really a sample app for playing with a Supabase backend, but might as well make a game out of it :)

## Development

1. Run `supabase init`
1. Run `supabase start`
1. Add a `.env` file to the root directory with the following:
   1. `SUPABASE_URL` for release build URL, from the console
   1. `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for release build token, from the console
   1. `SUPABASE_DEV_URL` for debug build URL, from the output of `supabase start`
   1. `SUPABASE_DEV_ANON_KEY` for debug build token, from the output of `supabase start`

## Outdated

Start the Firestore emulator
`firebase emulators:start`
